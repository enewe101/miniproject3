miniproject3
============
This project does not include the raw data.  You need to download the 
zip files for the data into data/raw.  Extract them there (they will make
their own sub-folders within data/raw)


To run the SIFT-bag-of-features-based classifier:
go to project-root/src/pre-processing and read the README located there!
